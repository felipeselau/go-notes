# Shopify CA to CA-FR Translation

**TL;DR ‚Äì Translating the Rove Lab CA Store to Quebec French**  

To localize the Rove Lab CA store for Quebec French:
- ensure the theme is internationalization-ready (t filters, locales support). 
- Shopify‚Äôs **Translate & Adapt** app should be used for translating core content like products, collections, pages, and SEO metadata. It‚Äôs built-in, efficient, and supports both auto and manual translation. 
- For dynamic content from third-party apps, image-based sections, or advanced workflows, apps like **[Weglot](https://apps.shopify.com/weglot?utm_source=chatgpt.com)**, **[Langify](https://apps.shopify.com/langify?st_source=autocomplete&surface_detail=autocomplete_apps)**, or **[Transcy](https://apps.shopify.com/transcy-multiple-languages?st_source=autocomplete&surface_detail=autocomplete_apps)** are recommended. 
- A **Shopify developer** is required to adapt custom theme components, structure multilingual metafields, and handle any content not covered natively.
